          <p>
            I'm Mike Canale. I have brown hair and eyes. I have two legs and two
            arms. I also have two eyes and two ears. I find it interesting that
            animals are born with two of a lot of things. Humans are animals.
            Therefore, humans are born with two of a lot of things. I am a
            human. I mostly like being a human.<br />
            <br />
            I have two sons. I like them. Even though I have two of them, I
            wasn't born with them. They sort of came to me later in my life.
            It's merely a coincidence that I have two of them. They are both
            humans. They are both animals. They also have two of a lot of
            things. Spiders are born with eight legs. Spiders are not human, but
            they are animals. Weird.<br />
            <br />
            This is my website. Enjoy.<br />
